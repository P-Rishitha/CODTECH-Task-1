### **Introduction**  
The **BMI Calculator** is a simple and user-friendly **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** application built using **Python** and the **Tkinter** library. The project calculates the **Body Mass Index (BMI)** based on the user's height and weight, and it categorizes the result into four distinct groups: Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, and Obese.  

---

### **Features**  
- **Input Validation**: Ensures height and weight are positive numbers and prompts the user with an error message for invalid inputs.  
- **BMI Calculation**: Converts height from centimeters to meters and calculates BMI using the formula:  
   **BMI = weight (kg) / (height in meters)^2**.  
-  **BMI Categories**: Classifies BMI into categories:  
   - **Underweight**: BMI < 18.5  
   - **Normal weight**: BMI between 18.5–24.9  
   - **Overweight**: BMI between 25–29.9  
   - **Obese**: BMI ≥ 30  
- **Real-Time Display**: Displays the calculated BMI and corresponding category in a clean format.  
- **Error Handling**: Shows a pop-up message for invalid inputs using Tkinter's messagebox.

### **Technology Used**  
- **Python** 
- **Tkinter** (Python’s standard GUI library)  

---

### **How It Works**  
1. The user inputs their height (in centimeters) and weight (in kilograms).  
2. On clicking the **"Calculate BMI"** button, the program:  
   - Validates the inputs.  
   - Calculates the BMI using the formula.  
   - Determines the BMI category.  
3. The result is displayed, showing both the **BMI value** and the **category**.  

---

### **User Interface**  
The application is designed with a minimalistic and clean layout:  
- Input fields for **Height** and **Weight**.  
- A **"Calculate BMI"** button to process the input.  
- A result display area to show the BMI and corresponding category.  

---

### **Applications**  
- Personal health tracking.  
- Educational purposes for learning GUI development in Python.  
- Demonstrates **input validation**, **error handling**, and **logical conditions** in Python.

This project is an excellent starting point for beginners to learn **GUI programming** and real-world application development in Python!
